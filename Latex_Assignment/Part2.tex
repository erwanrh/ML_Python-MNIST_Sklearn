\section{Part 2}

\subsection{Loss Function}
Our custom loss function is an accuracy score with a penalty on inter-class errors. If the predicted value is different than the true value then the error count will increase +1. We decided to separate the data into two classes : 
\begin{table}[hbt]
\centering
  \begin{tabular}{l|c|c}
   Data & $\geq 5$ & $<5$ \\
    \hline
   Class & 0 & 1 
  \end{tabular}
\end{table}

If a label from class 0 is predicted in class 1, then the error count will increase +1 extra so the total error will be +2. The counts are as follows : 


The formula is : 
\begin{equation*}
	Loss = \sum^n_{i=1} 
\end{equation*}

\subsection{Pipeline}
We chose to use a MaxAbsAscaler on the data because we want to minimize their variance knowing by constraining them to be between 0 and 1. In fact, our features represent a color code that goes from 0 to 255 which can be easily scaled to a [0,1] interval without any loss of information.

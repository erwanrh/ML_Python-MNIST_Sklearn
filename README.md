# Handwritten digits recognition with Scikit-Learn 
Machine Learning on MNIST dataset :handwritten digits recognition. 

## Database
MNIST

## Models
We compare several ML algorithms : 
* kNN
* SVM
* Random Forest

## Pipeline
We use the pipeline methods to pre-process the data :
* Standard scaling
* Binarizer

## Loss function
We create our own loss function to penalize the errors when they are made between those two classes : {0,1,2,3,4} and {5,6,7,8,9}
